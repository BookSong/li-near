# li-near
A easy-to-use linear algebra library with nodejs, using lapack for good performance.


## Notes for windows users
If you use x64 system, you can copy contents from ./lapack directory to ~/system32/ or place it in the root directory of your node project. If you use x32 system, you can download x32 versions of the two files and do the same. I haven't figured out a more out-of-the-box way to do this, please feel free to let me know if you have ideas.

## Notes for Linux users
You have to install lapack first. With most Linux distribtutions it is already installed in /usr/lib64/.

## Other systems
I do not have access to other systems, so if you have a solution please let me know.
